General Guidelines for Test Driven Development

* Step 1. Code the test function. Run the test. The test will definitely fail because the method hasn't been implemented yet

* Step 2. Code the method stub that will always return True

* Step 3. Code more test functions to trigger fail conditions. This indicates that your method stub is working "correctly"

* Step 4. Implement the complete the logic for the method. Run the tests. Tests should now pass

* Step 5. Repeat Steps 1 to 4 for all the other methods

* Step 6. Finally, refactor the code, e.g. max 5 lines for every function
